            <p>The Bible says in Matthew 7:13-14, “Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: 14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.” The nature of the present world makes it extremely difficult for a heavenly-minded person to live comfortably on this earth. Man by nature is lazy, easy-going and careless. But the conditions for making heaven are the direct opposite of the nature and desires of the flesh. Hence, whoever must have eternal life in heaven must be determined and prepared, ready to deny the natural desires of the flesh.</p>
